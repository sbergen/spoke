# exemplify

Checks or updates a code snippet in the README markdown.

Currently not generic or descriptive enough to be published,
but leave me a note if you'd want a version of this :)


Example, which is auto-updated locally, checked on CI:
```gleam
import exemplify

pub fn main() {
  exemplify.update_or_check()
}
```
