//// A MQTT session can span over multiple connections.
//// This module defines an actor that lives for the duration of one connection.
//// While most packets will be controlled by the session,
//// the following are handled by the connection:
//// - `Connect` and `ConnAck`
//// - `PinReq` and `PingResp`
//// as these don't interact with the session.
//// `ConnAck` is also sent to the session as a FYI on the status.
//// 
//// Killing the connection actor on protocol violations
//// simplifies handling e.g. invalid packets,
//// which should immediately close the channel
//// according to the MQTT specification.
